PubSubHubbub
============

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: The PubSubHubbub protocol has now been adopted by the W3C as a Candidate Recommandation. It's also been renamed [WebSub](https://github.com/w3c/websub) for clarity and concision. Please consider upgrading all older PubSubHubbub implementations to WebSub.


**PubSubHubbub** is an open protocol for distributed publish/subscribe communication on the Internet. It generalizes the concept of webhooks
and allows data producers and data consumers to work in a decoupled way.

PubSubHubbub provides a way to subscribe, unsubscribe and receive updates from a resource, whether it's an RSS or Atom feed or any web accessible document (JSON...).

The current version of the spec is 0.4. Please, [read it here](http://pubsubhubbub.github.io/PubSubHubbub/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html).

Open hubs are provided by:
* [Superfeedr](http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/)
* [Google](http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/)
* Aaron Parecki: [p3k](https://switchboard.p3k.io/)
* Christian Weiske: [phubb](http://phubb.cweiske.de/)

Several other publishing platforms, like Wordpress, include their own hubs.
