		<title>Dave Winer: Grateful Dead</title>
		<link>http://www.scripting.com/blog/categories/gratefulDead.html</link>
		<description>A high-fidelity Grateful Dead song every day. This is where we're experimenting with enclosures on RSS news items that download when you're not using your computer. If it works (it will) it will be the end of the Click-And-Wait multimedia experience on the Internet. </description>

			<description>It's been a few days since I added a song to the Grateful Dead channel. Now that there are all these new Radio users, many of whom are tuned into this channel (it's #16 on the hotlist of upstreaming Radio users, there's no way of knowing how many non-upstreaming users are subscribing, have to do something about this..). Anyway, tonight's song is a live version of Weather Report Suite from Dick's Picks Volume 7. It's wistful music. Of course a beautiful song, oft-quoted here on Scripting News. &lt;i&gt;A little change, the wind and rain.&lt;/i&gt;

			<description>Moshe Weitzman says Shakedown Street is what I'm lookin for for tonight. I'm listening right now. It's one of my favorites. "Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart." Too bright. I like the jazziness of Weather Report Suite. Dreamy and soft. How about The Other One? "Spanish lady come to me.."</description>
